## Enabling/Disabling vault usage
You can enable or disable vault secret usage without modifying kubernetes yaml files. By default vault usage is set to false inside value.yaml file but we override this value with VAULT_ENABLE_DEV, VAULT_ENABLE_QA, VAULT_ENABLE_INS, VAULT_ENABLE_DEMO, VAULT_ENABLE_DS variables from Settings >> CI/CD for each environment. If you change variable value from Settings >> CI/CD you need to manually start new pipline from CI/CD >> Pipelines.
